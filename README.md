#### Abstract
Gender discrimination is one of the biggest problems that we still face in the 21st century. In this research, we used clustering machine learning techniques to analyze discriminatory laws and regulations across 179 different countries. Using the K-Means clustering algorithm, we were able to group countries into one of three clusters to show which countries share similar levels of gender equality and their attitudes towards the equal treatment of their citizens.

#### Research Questions
- By assessing discriminatory regulations, can we state which governments are actively working to lessen the gender gap?
- Which governments/countries have the best policies in place to protect and     empower their female citizens?

#### Data
- This data has been extracted from the OECD (Organization ov Economic Co-Operation and Development)
